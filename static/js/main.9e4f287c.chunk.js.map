And likewise, if you are distressed because you are failing to accomplish some particular action which strikes you as sound, why do you not persist in the action rather than yield to the distress? ‘But something too strong for me is blocking my way.’ Then you should not be distressed, because the responsibility for your failure to act does not rest with you.—‘But my life is not worth living if this act is left undone.’—Then depart from life with generous feelings in your heart, dying in the same spirit as one who achieves his purpose, and reconciled, too, to what has stood in his way.”\n      \n      Book 8: verse 47\n      `,\n    },\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      text: 'patience',\n      meditation: `“Remember that your ruling centre becomes invincible when it withdraws into itself and rests content with itself, doing nothing other than what it wishes, even where its refusal to act is not reasonably based; and how much more contented it will be, then, when it founds its decision on reason and careful reflection.
